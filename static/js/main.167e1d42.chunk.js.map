Below is a screenshot of what it looked like when I started working on it:\n                </p>\n                <img className=\"img-center\"style={{width: '700px' }}src={require('../img/cern/cern_old.png')} alt=\"Old NICE website\" />\n                <p>\n          After interviews, user group and organisational requirements analysis I learned that the Windows system at CERN is a pretty complex one too. A windows computer could be hardened, locally or centrally managed. And while these terms did not mean much for a technical person, they did have impact on end user experience. Further to this, since the system was this complex, many of departments at CERN who used Windows hired people tasked specifically with helping set up and manage Windows computers. And while IT department was aware of this they did not realise these people have come up a middleman between them and the end users.\n                </p>\n                <img className=\"img-center\"style={{width: '700px' }} src={require('../img/cern/cardsort.png')} alt=\"Card sorting experiment\" />\n                <p>\n                    Therefore my challenge for this project was to simplify this complexity for end users- give them only key facts they needed to know and to give them tools to be able to work and troubleshoot with their computers more independently.\n            </p>\n            <h2> Design Process </h2>\n                <p>\n                I conducted card sorting experiment to not only learn how end users would organize the content and to inform the information architecture but also to learn which of the services currently living on the website could be more useful to a wider variety of people.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Using the data I collected, after several stages of storyboarding, wireframing, validating and throwing away ideas a much cleaner and simpler version of Windows services website was born.\n            </p>\n            <img className=\"img-center\" style={{width: '1000px' }} src={require('../img/cern/wireframes.png')} alt=\"Wireframing\" />\n            <p>\n                    Services were renamed, categorised into basic and advanced tools, and they also had help articles accompanying each relevant service to save users time on trying to find how to do a specific task. \n            </p>\n            <img className=\"img-center\" style={{width: '700px' }} src={require('../img/cern/new_site_map.png')} alt=\"New sitemap\" />\n\n            <p>\n                    Further to this, I built relationships with local supporters and with their help created more tailored and relevant help contents including introducing the idea to feature frequently asked questions at the top and have a starters kit for new users.\n            </p>\n            <h2> Development </h2>\n            <p>\n                   Once the new design concept was tested with the users and approved by the IT department I started working on it as lead front end developer together with another person who was responsible for the back end of the service. We were responsible for the design of the technical architecture of the service too.\n                   Technologies I worked with were React.js, SCSS, Webpack, Node.js, Openshift and others. I implemented SSO, routing restrictions and communications with various APIs from the client as well as a system to store and search help articles within the application.\n            </p>\n             <img className=\"img-center\" style={{width: '600px' }} src={require('../img/cern/cern_tech.png')} alt=\"Technical architecture\" />\n             <h2> Reflection </h2>\n            <p>\n                Due to limited resources and the time it took some key stakeholders to agree on some details for this project we had a very its tight timeframe for development.

We learned that there are many active online second hand item buying and selling markets in Finland: from facebook groups to tori.fi and others. From interviews and online surveys we learned that not as many people participate in those because often after buying the item they have no way of transporting it. This was especially for true for items such as sofas, beds and other big items. Most of the delivery options available for those were really expensive. \n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                So we started to look for ways on how we could challenge that. After more research we learned about existing peer to peer delivery service which didn’t seem to be able to pick up volumes for the same employment laws that uber is struggling in Finland. So after ruling this and several other concepts out through extensive research, we came up with Tavarat Kotiin or Items2Home.\n                            </p>\n\n                <h2>Approach and Solution</h2>\n                            <p>\n                                Items2Home is a service which does multiple deliveries on the same route by combining pick ups from multiple sellers and delivering to multiple buyers. \n                                <img className=\"img-center\"style={{width: '700px' }}src={require('../img/tk/TK2HOW.png')} alt=\"Our approach\" />\n\n                                We researched laws, competition, relationships between buyers and sellers online markets to understand how to tackle trust, payment and scheduling issues.  In total we conducted 64 experiments informing the development of our concept: both the user interface of the web service as well as the business model and how the communication on the delivery days would work.\n\n                            </p>\n                    \n                            \n                            <img className=\"img-center\"style={{width: '700px' }}src={require('../img/tk/tk_thum3d.png')} alt=\"Our approach\" />\n\n                  \n                   <p>\n                    Our MVP was a van going around Helsinki area once a week.

We had faced this ourselves when we had moved to Stockholm and also while traveling. Tinder, meet ups do not quite do the job as the former is for dating and in the latter you meet in large groups typically for a specific purpose. But what if you want someone to hang out with? Go to theatre? Watch football? Or, to have just one beer.\n                        </p>\n                        <h2> Approach</h2>\n                        <p>After field study in a couple of bars, two online experiments in Facebook and Jodel, we learned that meeting new people is a real problem. This can be true both for young people in a new place or for those that are older but would like a partner for a new or old hobby. So, we have come up with Just a Beer - a mobile app to make hangouts easy.</p>\n                       <p> The diagram below illustrates the development process of our app: </p>\n                       <img className=\"img-center\"style={{width: '700px' }}src={require('../img/beer/beer_process.png')} alt=\"Process\" />\n\n                       \n                <p>\n                    The creator of the hangout has the right to select one or more people to meet up with.

We chose this framework because it allows for the usage of Android native suitable elements so since our end goal was an Android app, this was perfect for our prototyping needs.

We chose Firebase as our database and backend solution.

I led the user research, did the analysis of the findings which informed our further development. I also created the storyboards, drew paper prototypes that we later discussed and combined. I worked on the clickable prototype and moved it to InVision app. In the web app development stage I worked on home and profile views of the Ionic app including styling and adding the logic from a static json file we used. Finally, in the Android app, I was worked on the profile, create hangout views, styling. I also implemented the logic for the profile when connecting the app with Firebase making the calls and passing the data from other fragments using intent.\n                    </p>\n                    <NavLink to=\"/\" className=\"button-link\">Close project</NavLink>\n                    </div>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n\n}","import React from 'react';\n//import './App.css';\nimport './index.scss';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Switch,\n  Route,\n  NavLink\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Who from './components/who';\nimport Side from './components/side';\nimport Projects from './components/projects';\nimport cern from './components/cern';\nimport tk from './components/tk';\nimport justabeer from './components/justabeer';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n    <div>\n      <nav className=\"navigation\">\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n            <NavLink to=\"/\" className=\"link\">Home</NavLink>\n          </li>\n          <li><a className=\"link\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MltdR9UAXKmtT8l2V1UM6ik_0XhAUPaJ/view?usp=sharing\">\n  CV\n</a></li>\n        </ul>\n      </nav>\n      {/* A <Switch> looks through its children <Route>s and\n          renders the first one that matches the current URL. */}\n      <Switch>\n        <Route path=\"/\" component={Projects}>\n          <Projects />\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path=\"/side\" component={Side}>\n          <Side />\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path=\"/who\" component={Who}>\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path=\"/windowstoolbox\" component={cern}>\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path=\"/tavaratkotiin\" component={tk}>\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path=\"/justabeer\" component={justabeer}>\n        </Route>\n      </Switch>\n    </div>\n  </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n/*\n <nav className=\"navigation\">\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <NavLink to=\"/\" className=\"link\">Projects</NavLink>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <NavLink to=\"/side\" className=\"link\">Side</NavLink>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <NavLink to=\"/who\" className=\"link\">Who</NavLink>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n*/","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
